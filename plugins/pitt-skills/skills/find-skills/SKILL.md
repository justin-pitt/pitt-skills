# Find Skills

Discover and install skills from the open agent skills ecosystem.

## When to Use

- User asks "how do I do X" where X might have an existing skill
- User says "find a skill for X" or "is there a skill for X"
- User wants to extend agent capabilities
- User mentions needing help with a specific domain

## Skills CLI

The Skills CLI (`npx skills`) is the package manager for agent skills:

- `npx skills find [query]` - Search for skills
- `npx skills add <package>` - Install a skill from GitHub
- `npx skills check` - Check for updates
- `npx skills update` - Update all installed skills

Browse skills at: https://skills.sh/

## How to Help

### Step 1: Understand the need

Identify the domain (React, testing, design, deployment), specific task, and whether a skill likely exists.

### Step 2: Check leaderboard

Check https://skills.sh/ for well-known skills in the domain before searching.

### Step 3: Search

```bash
npx skills find [query]
```

### Step 4: Verify quality

1. **Install count** — Prefer 1K+ installs. Caution under 100.
2. **Source reputation** — Official sources (vercel-labs, anthropics, microsoft) are more trustworthy.
3. **GitHub stars** — Check the source repository.

### Step 5: Present options

Show skill name, what it does, install count, source, and install command.

### Step 6: Offer to install

```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo@skill> -g -y
```
